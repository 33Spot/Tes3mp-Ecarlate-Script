Replace all the block to

    function BasePlayer:SetDifficulty(difficulty)
        local difficultyMin = config.difficulty
        local currentLevel = tes3mp.GetLevel(self.pid)
        local difficultyTest = difficultyMin + ((currentLevel - 1) * 4)
        if (difficultyTest >= 0 and difficultyTest <= 200) then
            difficulty = difficultyTest - difficultyTest % 4
        end
        self.data.settings.difficulty = difficulty
        tes3mp.SetDifficulty(self.pid, difficulty)
        tes3mp.LogMessage(1, "Set difficulty to " .. tostring(difficulty) .. " for " .. myMod.GetChatName(self.pid))
